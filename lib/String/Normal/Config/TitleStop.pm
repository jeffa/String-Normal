=head1 NAME

String::Normal::Config::TitleStop;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package defines removals to be performed on Title types.

=head1 STRUCTURE

One entry per line. Each value will be removed. Special characters
C<^> and C<$> are NOT used. You can prepend C<#> to lines that you
wish to skip. For example:

    the
    #and

Would remove all occurances of C<the> but not C<and>. Special character
C<,> is used to override removal if the final number of tokens if less
then the digit specified. For example:

    the,2

Would remove all occurances of C<the> in "The Generic Title" but would
not remove any occurances in "The The".

You can provide your own data by creating a text file containing your
values and provide the path to that file via the constructor:

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new( title_stop => '/path/to/values.txt' );
