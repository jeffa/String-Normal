=head1 NAME

String::Normal::Config::TitleStem;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package defines substitutions to be performed on title types.

=head1 STRUCTURE

One entry pair per line: first the value to be matched then the value
to be changed to. For example:

  foo fu

Would change all occurances of C<foo> to C<fu>. See C<__DATA__> block below.

You can provide your own data by creating a text file containing your
values and provide the path to that file via the constructor:

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new( title_stem => '/path/to/values.txt' );
