=head1 DESCRIPTION

THIS MODULE IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!

Transform strings into a normal form. Performs tokenization, snowball stemming,
stop word removal and complex name compression.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new( %params )>

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new( %params );

Constructs object. Accepts the following named parameters:

=back

=over 8

=item * C<type>

Available types: business, address, phone, city, state, zip and title.
Defaults to C<business>.

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new( type => 'title' );

=item * various configuration overides

See L<TYPE CLASSES> for more information.

=back

=over 4

=item C<transform( $word )>

  my $scalar = $normalizer->transform( 'Alien 1979 1080p.avi' );

Normalizes word based on given type.

=back

=head1 TYPE CLASSES

Consider the following values:

    Bary & Sons' Bakery
    Bary's & Sons Bakeries
    Bary's and Sons' Bakeries

These are business names as potentialy found in business listings. 
When each of these values is passed to C<transform()> the return value
will be "bakeri bari son." This is accomplished by a number of transformation
rules, found in the respective C<Type> class.

=over 4

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::Business>

Rules for business name listings, such as "Bary's Bakery".
Provides C<business_stem>, C<business_stop> and C<business_compress> data overides:

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new( business_stem => '/path/to/stem.txt' );

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::Address>

Rules for business address listings, such as "123 Main Street Suite A".
Provides C<address_stem> and C<address_stop> data overides:

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new(
      type          => 'address',
      business_stem => '/path/to/stem.txt',
  );

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::City>

Rules for names of cities.

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::State>

Rules for US and Canadian state codes.

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::Zip>

Rules for US and Canadian zip codes.

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::Phone>

Rules for US area and exchange phone codes.
Provides C<area_codes> data overides:

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new(
      type       => 'phone',
      area_codes => '/path/to/codes.txt',
  );

=item * L<String::Normal::Type::Title>

Rules for movie, film and television show titles.
Provides C<title_stem> and C<title_stop> data overides:

  my $normalizer = String::Normal->new(
      type       => 'title',
      title_stop => '/path/to/stop-words.txt',
  );

=back

The movitation for such transformation is to identify duplicates when combining
multiple digest feeds into a master feed. This transformation (called normalization
here) was designed with the need to identify and match duplicate business listings,
but can be used to match duplicated from other sources as well, such as movie, film
and television show titles.

Each type uses data found in a respective Config class.

=head1 CONFIG CLASSES

=head3 Business

Business values are first compressed, then stemmed via L<Lingua::Stem>
(with customizations) and finally stop worded.

=over 4

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::BusinessStop>

Contains stop words to be removed from business names.

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::BusinessStem>

Stem words are transformed into some normal form, business types
use L<Lingua::Stem> with some customizations.

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::BusinessCompress>

Compress words are combined into one word. Consider:

    Box*Mart
    Box-Mart
    Box Mart
    BoxMart

These are all "compressed" into the value C<boxmart> by specifying
the value C<box-mart> in the compression list.

=back

=head3 Address

Address values are first stemmed with a simple substitution and then finally stop worded.

=over 4

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::AddressStop>

Contains stop words to be removed from addresses.

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::AddressStem>

Transforms into some normal form, but does not use L<Lingua::Stem>.

=back

=head3 Title

Title values are stop worded first, then stemmed via L<Lingua::Stem>.

=over 4

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::TitleStop>

Contains stop words to be removed from titles.

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::TitleStem>

Transforms into some normal form, via L<Lingua::Stem> with no customizations.

=back

=head3 State

=over 4

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::State>

Valide US and Canadian state codes.

=back

=head3 Phone

=over 4

=item * L<String::Normal::Config::AreaCodes>

Valid US area codes.

=back

All Config classes can be overriden by specifying your own
custom text files.

=head1 CLI TOOLS

=over 4

=item * C<normalizer>

Quickly transform values without writing a script:

  $ normalizer --value='Jones & Sons Bakeries'

  $ normalizer --value='Los Angeles' --type='city'

  $ normalizer --file=addresses.txt --type=address
